# tile-r

Tile-r lets you turn a picture from a URL into a tiled image. You can use a slider to change the size of the tiles. The purpose of building this [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html "React Homepage") app was to see what kind of results [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F "Midjourney Homepage") could produce using the `--tile` command.

Here are a few links to some tiles I made using Midjourney.  Drop 'em into [tile-r](https://intuitiveharmony.github.io/tile-r/ "tile-r on the web") and check it out!
